## Problem Definition ( Recognize grape diseases- Deep learning )
Grape diseases are dangerous, and if left untreated, they can wipe out entire crop fields.
When the problem is not addressed quickly enough, the economy and farmers are likely
to suffer more losses. The levels of employment and exportation are likely to
reduce. The groupâ€™s challenge is to find an effective solution for detecting and preventing the
destruction of grapes, thus reducing the severity of the effects of grape diseases. The challenge
is to develop a deep learning algorithm that can correctly identify grape diseases in
order to help grape farmers.
